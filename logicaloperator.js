// logical operators = used to combine or manipulate boolean values
//                      (true or false)
//                    AND  = &&
//                    OR = ||
//                    NOT = !

// && mena if both condition are true then first if logic ahppen if anyone is false it happen false condition in AND operaotrs case
// example of AND operators case with if and else logic
//const temp = 30;

//if(temp >0 && temp <= 30){
    //console.log("The weather is GOOD");
//}
//else{
    //console.log("The weather is BAD");
//}

// || OR operators means at least one condition should be true 

//let temp = -23 ;

//if(temp <= 0 || temp > 30){
  //console.log("The weather is BAD");
//}
//else{
    //console.log("The weather is GOOD")
//}


// ! NOT mean it change the logic of if and else if it output is if it make else or if else is correct output ir make it output if as it flif the if and else logic and output and change  and make opposite.


//const isSunny = true;

//if(!isSunny){
    //console.log("Today is CLOUDY");
//}
//else{
    //console.log("Today is SUNNY");
//}


//
